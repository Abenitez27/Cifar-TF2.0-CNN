# Cifar-TF2.0-CNN
CNN Model over the Cifar data set.
The two Jupiter notebooks require a GPU to run and build the CNN models it is recommended to run the notebooks in Google Colabs free environment and adding a GPU to the notebook. 
The two notebooks are over the same Cifar dataset but one is an improved version with an added data augmentation image generator from Keras.
This is only for learning purposes.
